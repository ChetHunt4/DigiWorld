# DigiWorld
## Overview
I started this project as a way to create an advanced simulation that, to the best of my ability, will take concepts from sociology, economics, civics, city planning,
and other topics to create a rich simulation that can simulate the dynamics of very small towns all the way out to the entire planet. In other words the Dwarf Fortress of City Builders.

## Current Capabilities
- Agent classes are defined
- Tile building tool is built in WPF and allows for creating .PRJ files which are just Json files that list maps and properties that can then be converted to json to be used by the simulation/game.

## Next Steps
- Create a new project either in WPF using SkiaSharp or Monogame that can at least allow the simulation to be run/game to be played in 2D.
- Flesh out agent behavior.
