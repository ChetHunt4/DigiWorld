# DigiWorld
## Overview
I started this project as a way to create an advanced simulation that, to the best of my ability, will take concepts from sociology, economics, civics, city planning,
and other topics to create a rich simulation that can simulate the dynamics of very small towns all the way out to the entire planet.

## Goals
Currently I am trying to conceptualize the simulation and it will be represented by a console app. I would eventually like to abstract it out into a game that will use
Unreal Engine 5 with PCG (Procedurally Generated Content) to represent the simulation.
